This is a set of Java projects for communicating with various types of sensor interfaces that
are typically used in schools. 

TODO
- switch all JNI projects to JNA projects
- separate out rxtx dependent code from sensor since that won't be easy to put in maven central
- find a way to remove jna-jws dependency from here, or get it upstream if we can't get rid of it
- get jars deployed to maven central
- update documentation to make it really easy to try out by pulling jars from central
- consider bringing in a refactored sensor-applet project or keep it in its own repo
- update labpro usb to work on OS X
