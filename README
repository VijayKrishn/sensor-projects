This is a set of Java libraries for communicating with various types of sensor interfaces that
are typically used in schools.

The current place to get started is to look at the ExampleSensorApp class. You can subclass this
and modify the deviceId and possibly openString in order to test out a specific device.

The list of available 'deviceId's is in the DeviceID interface.

If you don't have any hardware you can start with the PseudoSensorExampleApp which extends ExampleSensorApp.

TODO
- move ftdi-serial-wrapper into its own repository, it isn't used by any of this code and could be a useful independent project for someone
- get jars deployed to maven central
- update documentation to make it really easy to try out by pulling jars from central
- remove sensor native
- make sure the native libraries are not loaded multiple times in a single jvm
- make a command line app that lists the available devices, and runs the 2 tests on whichever device the user selects
