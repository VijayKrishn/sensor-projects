This is a set of Java projects for communicating with various types of sensor interfaces that
are typically used in schools.

TODO
- move ftdi-serial-wrapper into its own repository, it isn't used by any of this code and could be a useful independent project for someone
- get jars deployed to maven central
- update documentation to make it really easy to try out by pulling jars from central
- consider bringing in a refactored sensor-applet project or keep it in its own repo
- remove sensor native
